# `chromswitch`: Analysis

This document executes all the analysis presented in the paper *chromswitch: A flexible method for detecting chromatin state switches* (Selin Jessa and Claudia L. Kleinman).

The complete analysis: [https://rawgit.com/sjessa/chromswitch-analysis/master/analysis.html](https://rawgit.com/sjessa/chromswitch-analysis/master/analysis.html).

That's simply a rendered version of the `analysis.html` file in this repository, which is generated by `analysis.Rmd`. The R Markdown document contains the code to download the data, run experiments, and generate the figures included in the paper, along with some notes and comments. The introduction of the HTML document details the contents of this repository and specifies how to reproduce the complete analysis.

`chromswitch` is an R package which implements a flexible method to integrate epigenomic data to identify chromatin state switches in specific genomic regions of interest. It's currently available for download at [https://github.com/sjessa/chromswitch](https://github.com/sjessa/chromswitch).
